
#Defining a Tuple
#A tuple looks just like a list except you use parentheses instead of square
#brackets. Once you define a tuple, you can access individual elements by
#using each item’s index, just as you would for a list.

# Crear una tupla
tuple=('mango','pera','uva', 'mazana')
print(tuple)
tuple=(['mango','pera','uva', 'mazana']+['piña']) ## This option allow add element into tupla
print(tuple)
print(tuple[::2]) # Print every 2 elements
